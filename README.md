# DTGE Engine
DTGE, or Dynamic Text Game Engine is for creating text-based games with a high degree of responsiveness to player customization and choice through usage of a GUI editor friendly to non-technical users.

# Getting the engine
This will be where we instruct users how to install once we start releasing binary releases.

# Contributing to DTGE
DTGE is very early in development! We'll update this with steps for those interested in contributing in the future.
