{"Id":"startscene","SceneText":"You smile as you ring the doorbell, excited to see Anteros. It\u0027s been too long since you\u0027ve seen him, and you\u0027ve been excited for this visit since it was first planned. Thankfully, the wait for the door to open isn\u0027t nearly as long.\n\nThe door opens, and Anteros immediately says, \u0022Hey, it\u0027s great to see you!\u0022 He then pulls you into a tight hug. \u0022Come in, come in,\u0022 he says as he breaks the hug and waves you in. You quickly enter his apartment, the place clean and presentable. He leads you to the couch and the two of you sit, quickly chatting about what\u0027s happened since you last saw each other, both of you enjoying the chance to catch up. After only a few minutes, most of the big beats have been hit, and there\u0027s a brief pause.\n\n\u0022So,\u0022 Anteros begins to ask, \u0022what did you want to do tonight? I\u0027m happy to order delivery and we can continue to chat. However, if you want to skip straight to the bedroom, I\u0027d be happy to oblige that, too.\u0022 He says the last bit with a wink. You see Anteros still has that same mix of unrelenting horniness while being accomodating to any style.\n\nYou take a moment to ponder whether you want to take the evening slow, yet steady, or jump right into the sexy fun you both know was part of the plan eventually.","encodedSceneText":null,"optionList":[{"id":"slow","targetSceneId":"slow_start","displayName":"Slow","tooltip":null,"enabled":true},{"id":"jump_in","targetSceneId":"bedroom_arrival","displayName":"Jump In","tooltip":null,"enabled":true},null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null]}
